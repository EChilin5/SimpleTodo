## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Using the wrong FileUtils import for the project.

Having issues sharing the project on github and creating a token.

Had a weird issue where I had two instances of my account when I committed. 

The emulator is a bit slow so I thought it wasn't working at first.
Eventually it loaded successfully.

Similar issues as before emulator is a bit slow, so hard to tell if I use OnClicked correctly
